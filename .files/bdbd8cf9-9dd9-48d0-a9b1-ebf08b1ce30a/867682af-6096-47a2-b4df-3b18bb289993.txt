2.2   LITERATURE SURVEY  
â€¢  The paper "A Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model using Deep Learning"  by Akila V, 
Nitin M. V. S, Prasanth I, Sandeep Reddy M, and Akash Kumar G presents a machine 
learning approach for cryptocurrency price prediction. The paper discusses two key 
components: the effects of CPD (Cryptocurrency Price Data) and the attention me chanism, 
which are incorporated into the proposed SAM -LSTM (Self -Attention Mechanism Long 
Short -Term Memory) model. These components are first validated through their 
application in predicting univariate Bitcoin (BTC) prices. After confirming the 
effective ness of these techniques, the paper proceeds to evaluate the overall price prediction 
performance of the SAM -LSTM model. The validation of these techniques demonstrates 
the model's potential in improving the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions.
