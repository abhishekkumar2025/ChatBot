 CHAPTER 2 
LITERATURE SURVEY  
The literature survey for the â€œAI-Powered Crypto Price Prediction and Blockchain 
Wallet Transactions" highlights the use of AI models, such as deep learning, for predicting 
cryptocurrency prices with improved accuracy. Blockchain technology, particularly smart 
contracts, has been widely  applied for securing transactions. However, there is limited research 
combining AI -driven price prediction with blockchain for secure wallet transactions, indicating 
a gap that this project aims to fill.  
2.1 OVERVIEW  
 The project "AI -Powered Crypto Price Prediction and Blockchain Wallet Transactions" 
aims to develop a platform that integrates AI for accurate cryptocurrency price predictions and 
blockchain technology for secure wallet transactions. By leveraging deep lea rning models like 
transformers and CNNs, the system predicts future cryptocurrency prices based on historical 
market data. It also incorporates real -time price updates through API calls. For secure
